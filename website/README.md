# Project Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Deployment

The repository is auto-deployed using Netlify. Simply pushing to `main` will trigger a new deploy.
