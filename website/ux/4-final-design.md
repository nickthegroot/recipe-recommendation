# Final Design

Our final design took the findings from the entire experience and condensed it into its final form. Note that this is an interactive design - feel free to play around with it!

<div align="center">
<iframe
    style={{
        maxWidth: '100%',
        height: 'min(70vh, 700px)',
        aspectRatio: '390 / 844'
    }}

## Changes

While we made a lot of changes over the previous prototype, we wanted to specifically call-out certain ones.
