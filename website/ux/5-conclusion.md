# Conclusion

I truly believe this project has the ability to help people. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be difficult for many people, particularly for working adults who often find themselves overworked and underpaid. Itâ€™s all too easy to make unhealthy decisions (or worse, be **forced** to) under such conditions.

The idea for this app came about when I learned about the number of Americans working multiple jobs to make ends meet. According to a December 2022 report by the Federal Reserve, [roughly 388,000 Americans are currently working more than two full-time jobs](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNU02026631). Thatâ€™s nearly 5% of the entire U.S. workforce! Under such conditions, coming up with a healthy meal to cook at home must be one of the last things on their mind.

Giving people a quick way to plan and prepare healthy meals can allow them to get the nutrition they need in a country where fast food is commonplace and [obesity is at all-time highs](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html). [With excess weight correlated with a slew of other issues](https://www.ncoa.org/article/how-excess-weight-impacts-our-mental-and-emotional-health), this one change could fundamentally improve the lives of countless people.
